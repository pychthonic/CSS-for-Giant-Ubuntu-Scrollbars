# CSS-for-Giant-Ubuntu-Scrollbars

I hacked together this CSS a while ago before I'd worked with CSS buildling web pages, so it's sloppy but it works on Firefox, Libreoffice, Terminal, Document Viewer for pdfs, and File Manager.

Now that my CSS skills have gotten better, I'm going to copy the CSS file to a couple virtual machines and see if I can get it to work on Debian 9, Ubuntu 19, and Kali.

I'll clean up the code then too, as I can tell looking over it that there's a lot of repetition and unecessary rules. I don't wanna mess with the one my OS is using though cause it's too crucial for my workflow to risk messing up by tweaking it. I'll get on a VM though soon enough.
